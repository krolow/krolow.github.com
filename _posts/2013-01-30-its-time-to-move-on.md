This post it's to describe my goals for 2013, I know I'm bit late it's end of January, but...

The last 5 years, I've been working for a great company <a href="http://conrad-caine.com">Conrad Caine</a>, a full service agency for digital communication. When I had started in Conrad Caine, I had a great first impact, as the company headquartes is in Germany, the customers and projects were mainly focus in Europe, for me a Brazilian guy without any English background and starting to work for a multinational company was a quite challenging.

A long of time I could show my work....

I become a ninja in usage of Google Translate, and incredable I could learn a bit of english, and the things were moving smoothly...

By this time... I could introduce into the company the CakePHP framework, I had worked as front-end developer (Javascript, Objective-C), I have done some Java, some Python, a lot of PHP, used differents frameworks, CMS, etc...

So.. after some time I have got a new role in the company, Head of Backend, and it was once again challenging. 

I had to learn how to handle the team, how estimate projects, how to deal with customers, I had to think about strategies to apply in the backend team, what language to use, what frameworks, I had to figure out solutions for several differents projects/apps, I had to hire people, I had to train people, I had to demand results from people, and a lot of other things. It was an incredable experience to me, I think I had grew a lot professionally. 

Not to mention about people, I had met great profissionals at Conrad Caine, I had learned a lot from them, I had also made a lot of friends, and I can not forget about the <a href="http://hackthursday.com">Hack Thursday</a>, event that I have participated of creation, Hack Thursday was created inside the backend team of Conrad Caine.

But as I said in the title of the post it's time to move on, and I'll be starting a new journey.

I'll be starting to work at <a href="http://www.cakedc.com/">CakeDC</a>. It will be a totally new experience to me, as the fact that I'll be working full time remote. I'm looking for to increase a lot my technical background and also have a lot of fun doing my best at CakeDC.

More than ever, I'd like to help the CakePHP community, it is one of my top priorities for this year, I'll try create plugins, support the existing plugins, if possible help the development of the CakePHP framework, that is, I'd like to retrive back what I have learned a long of those years that I have been using CakePHP.

**Saying about goals, here are my goals for this year:**

* In the end of year I'd like to have written at least 24 posts in this blog;
* Get more involved in open source projects and publish more code at Github;
* Deploy at least 2 personal projects;
* Improve my english skills (I'm already looking for some courses to do)

Well I'll be looking for to achive my goals, and also to do a good job in my new journey.
