Hi! I'm a gaúcho from Brazil! 
<br />
I born and I still living in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=Pelotas+-+Rio+Grande+do+Sul,+Brasil&hl=pt-BR&ll=-31.729384,-52.362398&spn=0.353916,0.614548&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=42.03917,78.662109&oq=Pelotas,&t=w&hnear=Pelotas+-+Rio+Grande+do+Sul,+Brasil&z=11">Pelotas</a>. 
<br />
I've tried be an agronomist but I become a programmer...<br /><br />
I've been coding in PHP since 2001, but it was in 2005 that I got my first professional opporunity, since then I've been also using Javascript, Objective-C, Ruby, Python, Java and bit of C...
<br />
Nowadays I'm working as <a href="http://www.krolow.com.br/">self employed</a>.

I can say that my stereotype it's like several other programmers, but instead of drink coffe I drink <a href="https://www.google.com.br/search?q=chimarrao+gaucho&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og">chimarrão</a>.
<br />
I like to play with Arduino and I also try to play some acustic guitar and nowadays also an Ukulele.
<br />
I'm also a big fan of <a href="http://gebrasil.com.br">Brasil de Pelotas (Xavante)</a>, a small team here in my city but has huge amount of supporters.
